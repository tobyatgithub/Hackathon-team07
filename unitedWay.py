This is the main function serves the submission for the UnitedWay hackerson,
where we aim to provide a partial solution/contribution to the problem 1.

Problem 1 background:
A focus of the United Way British Columbia's Food Hubs is building long term 
partnerships in community for sustainable solutions to address food insecurity. 
That is strengthening connections between food producers, logistic providers, 
distributors and community agencies to provide food that is appropriate to 
the community, regularly available, and of high quality. 

Problem 1 description: 
Our current food hub locations are primarily a result of our community partner 
agencies and the assessed need in the community we serve. We need a way to 
location our new food hubs across the province to include considerations of 
where food producers and distributors are, proximity to major transportation 
routes, and nearby community partners.â€‹

============Our Solution============
Here we frame this problem 1 as a constraint optimization problem (COP), and use
google or-tools to find a viable solution.

In short, we try to find the best logistics to maximize happiness with a limited
budget. (i.e. logistics in the sense of which food hub shall buy food from which farm)

Our main purpose here is to show a powerful prototype that can potentially create
a huge amount of benefit by dramatically increase efficiency.


To frame this problem as a math model, we made the following assumptions:
1 - Stepped Happiness:
    we measure the happiness of local community by how many food they received 
    on average (per family). And we use a step function to regular the behavior,
    such that from 0 unit food to 1 unit food, there's a huge increase (+5), 
    from 1 unit food to 2 unit food, there's a very moderate increase (+2), 
    and from 2 unit food to more, there's a minimum increase (+1) and the 
    happiness is caped by 8 ( = 0 + 5 + 2 + 1).

2 - Farm's unlimited supply:
    we assume the production of any farm is far greater than what we could buy
    thus we don't constraint the farm supply here (if needed: we could add it on.)

3 - Hub's limited capacity:
    we assume each hub has a limited amount of food storage capacity, and this 
    value can not be infinite. (if needed: we can include hub maintainance as
    part of the cost)

4 - Cost only by travel:
    here we only calculated total cost based on transportation cost, that is the 
    cost to move X amount of food from farm A to hub B.

    And we assume the cost to be a function of distance multiply quantity (per unit 
    food).
