# Hackathon-team07

## Criteria
1. UWBC wants to ensure are Food Hubs are located both were food is most urgently needed, but also where food is produced.


## How to use
This repo comes with two working examples.
To run and see the results, git clone this repo, and add root location:
`python unitedWay.py`

Notice that you will need `pandas`, and `ortools` package.
(run `pip install pandas` and `pip install ortools` if you need to install them.)

In the `unitedWay.py`, one is a toy example, you can run it by setting the variable `DEBUG = True`. The other example is a somewhat more realistic example, you can run it by setting the variable `DEBUG = False` (at line 112 of `unitedWay.py`).
